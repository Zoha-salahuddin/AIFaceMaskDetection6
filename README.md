**🌸✨ AI Face Mask Detection System ✨🌸**

AI-Powered • Real-Time • University Group Project

---

**🌸 Project Overview**

The Face Mask Detection System is an AI-based computer vision project designed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real time using a webcam 📷.
This system uses Deep Learning (CNN) for image classification and OpenCV for real-time face detection.
The project is developed as part of a University academic group assignment to demonstrate practical applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

**⚙️ How the System Works**

1. Images are collected and labeled (Mask / No Mask)
2. Images are resized and normalized
3. A CNN model is trained for binary classification
4. Webcam captures live video frames
5. Faces are detected using OpenCV
6. The trained model predicts mask status in real time
